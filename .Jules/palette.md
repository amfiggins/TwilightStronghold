## 2026-01-29 - Roblox UI Interactivity
**Learning:** Roblox UI buttons lack built-in interactive feedback (hover/click) by default compared to web buttons, making interfaces feel 'dead'. Users need explicit visual confirmation for actions.
**Action:** Always implement custom MouseEnter/MouseLeave/MouseButton1Click handlers for interactive elements to improve perceived responsiveness.
