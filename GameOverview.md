# The Twilight Stronghold: Game Overview

> "Build by Day. Survive by Night. Farm Forever."

## 1. The Core Concept
**The Twilight Stronghold** is a **Hybrid Survival RPG** on Roblox that bridges the gap between chill, persistent collection games and high-stakes roguelite survival.

*   **The Vibe:** Cozy medieval guild meets terrifying night survival.
*   **The Hook:** Everything you build and collect in the **Lobby** makes you stronger in the **War Zone**, but the War Zone is where the real glory (and loot) lies.

## 2. The Mechanics (The "Split Loop")

### Phase A: The Lobby (Persistent Progression)
*   **Role:** The "Hub" and "Safe Zone". Your progress here is permanent.
*   **Gameplay Style:** Low-stress, social, farming-focused (inspired by *Fisch*).
*   **Key Features:**
    *   **Resource Gathering:** Fishing in the guild lake, mining in the quarry, chopping ancient trees.
    *   **Crafting & Upgrading:** Use resources to forge **Loadout Items** (weapons, armor, base blueprints).
    *   **Meta-Progression:** Unlock permanent Class Upgrades (Warrior, Mage, Builder) using "Diamonds" earned from survival.
    *   **Sanctuary Zones:** Dedicated areas for AFK farming (lower rates, but automatic) to respect player time.

### Phase B: The War Zone (Session Survival)
*   **Role:** The "Instance" and "Challenge". Resets every match.
*   **Gameplay Style:** High-intensity, cooperative tower defense (inspired by *99 Nights*).
*   **The Challenge:** Survive as many nights as possible against waves of monsters.
*   **The Day/Night Cycle:**
    *   ☀️ **Day:** Frantic gathering and building. Place walls, towers, and traps using your **Base Kit**.
    *   🌙 **Night:** Combat! Defend your base from The Swarm.
*   **The Stakes:** If you die, the session ends. You keep your Meta-Currency (Diamonds), but the base is gone.

### Phase C: The Meta-Link (Connecting the Two)
*   **The Loadout System:** You don't go into battle empty-handed.
    *   **Bring 1 Weapon:** (e.g., *Void Slayer Greatsword*) crafted in the Lobby.
    *   **Bring 1 Base Kit:** (e.g., *Tier 3 Watchtower Blueprint*) to start the match with a massive advantage.

## 3. Future Roadmap & Idea Board
*These are the "Big Ideas" planned for future updates to deepen the lore and gameplay.*

### 🔮 Lore & Unique Mechanics
*   **The Night Stalker:** A boss monster that doesn't just kill—it **hunts**. It adapts to your defenses.
*   **Capture & Rescue:** Instead of dying, players can be "captured" by the Stalker and dragged to its lair. Teammates must launch a daring rescue mission to save them.
*   **Villager Rescue:** Find lost NPCs (Baker, Blacksmith) in the War Zone and escort them to your base. If they survive, they unlock temporary buffs or shops for that session.

### 🌍 Expansion Content
*   **New Biomes:**
    *   **The Ice Lake:** A frozen Lobby zone with unique "Ice Fishing" and "Glacier Mining".
    *   **Volcanic Forge:** A dangerous high-level crafting area.
*   **Guild System:**
    *   **Guild Halls:** A shared Lobby space for your clan.
    *   **Party Saves:** Save the state of a massive "Endless Mode" survival run and resume it later with your friends.

## 4. Technical Pillars
*   **Rojo Workflow:** Professional-grade development syncing VS Code to Roblox Studio.
*   **Data Persistence:** Robust DataStores ensure no loot is ever lost.
*   **Performance:** Optimized for massive waves of enemies without lag.
