## 2024-04-08 - Fast Distance Calculations
**Learning:** In Roblox Luau, comparing squared distance using explicit multiplication (`delta.X * delta.X + delta.Y * delta.Y + delta.Z * delta.Z < thresholdSq`) is significantly faster than using `Vector3.Magnitude` because it avoids costly square root operations and property getter overhead.
**Action:** Always use squared distance checks in hot paths like AI loops, frequent position validation, or finding the nearest target.
## 2024-05-25 - Caching Players List
**Learning:** Calling `Players:GetPlayers()` allocates a new array on every invocation, leading to significant garbage collection overhead in high-frequency loops (like AI per-frame updates).
**Action:** Cache the player list in a module-level table and keep it synchronized using `Players.PlayerAdded` and `Players.PlayerRemoving` events.
