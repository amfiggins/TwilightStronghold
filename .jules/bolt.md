## 2024-04-08 - Fast Distance Calculations
**Learning:** In Roblox Luau, comparing squared distance using explicit multiplication (`delta.X * delta.X + delta.Y * delta.Y + delta.Z * delta.Z < thresholdSq`) is significantly faster than using `Vector3.Magnitude` because it avoids costly square root operations and property getter overhead.
**Action:** Always use squared distance checks in hot paths like AI loops, frequent position validation, or finding the nearest target.

## 2024-05-26 - GetConnectedGamepads Allocation Overhead
**Learning:** Calling `UserInputService:GetConnectedGamepads()` repeatedly (e.g., inside a `RenderStepped` loop) allocates a new table on every invocation, causing unnecessary garbage collection pressure and stuttering in high-frequency loops.
**Action:** Always maintain a module-level cached list of gamepads using the `GamepadConnected` and `GamepadDisconnected` events instead of polling `GetConnectedGamepads()` every frame.
