## 2024-04-08 - Fast Distance Calculations
**Learning:** In Roblox Luau, comparing squared distance using explicit multiplication (`delta.X * delta.X + delta.Y * delta.Y + delta.Z * delta.Z < thresholdSq`) is significantly faster than using `Vector3.Magnitude` because it avoids costly square root operations and property getter overhead.
**Action:** Always use squared distance checks in hot paths like AI loops, frequent position validation, or finding the nearest target.

## 2024-05-21 - O(1) Lookup for Ordered Collections
**Learning:** Checking for membership in an ordered array (like a matchmaking queue) using `table.find` requires an O(N) scan, which scales poorly.
**Action:** Use a companion dictionary/set alongside the array to achieve O(1) membership lookups while preserving order, explicitly synchronizing it during insertions, removals, and batch processing.
